The enc28j60 is an ethernet module with an SPI interface. This project includes the schematics, gerber files, BOM, and pick and place files for a SMT only enc28j60 board. This board can either be ordered directly, or be integrated into other projects. On the raspberry pi zero W, speeds up to 4Mb/s have been seen.

This board was designed with EasyEda, and can be easily ordered from JLCPCB.com. The easyeda zip file can be loaded into the online editor https://easyeda.com/editor.
